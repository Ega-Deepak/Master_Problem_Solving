APPROACH:
   -> Fibonacci numbers are numbers which is sum of previous two numbers.
    Ex: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,.....
      -> Here 0,1 are default values and third number is previous of two numbers which is 0+1=1.
      -> And fourth fibonacci number is sum of 3rd and 2nd fibonacci number 1+1=2.
#CODE
   class Solution {
    public static int[] printFibb(int n) {
        int[] fiboArr = new int[n];
        int a=1,b=1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            fiboArr[i]=a;
            int c=a+b;
            a=b;
            b=c;
        }
        return fiboArr;
      }
    }
#EXPLANATION:
   -> Here we set first two values as default.
   -> and created an array to store the fibonacci values in that index.
   -> and lastly we are returning that array.
   -> but in this approach we set values as 1 and 1 because the problem want to store values
      from 1st fibonacci number, so we set values from 1.
#TIME COMPLEXITY
   -> Here we are iterating an array of size N so time complxity is O(N).
