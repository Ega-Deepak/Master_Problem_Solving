# APPROACH: 
  -> Here we need to count the factors of a given number. Where factors are the number which gives remainder as zero when we divide the number by any number.
     Ex: 5
       -> Factors of 5 are 1 and 5, when we divide 5 with 1 and 5 the remainder is 0 so they are the factors of that number. so every time the number is factor then we need
          to increment the counter variable and lastly we need to return counter variable.
# CODE
  class Solution{
    static int countFactors(int N) {
        int factorsCount=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
            if(N%i==0){
                factorsCount++;
            }
        }
        return factorsCount;
     }
  }

#TIME COMPLEXITY
   -> Here we iterate loop from 1 to N so time complexity is O(N).
