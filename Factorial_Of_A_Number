APPROACH:
   -> Factorial of number means multiplication of 1 to that number.
        Ex: factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.
   -> Factorial of Zero is 1.
#CODE
   class Solution {
    static int factorial(int n) {
        int factSum=1;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            factSum=factSum*i;
        }
        return factSum;
       }
   }
#EXPLAINATION:
    -> A for loop runs from 1 to n (inclusive). In each iteration, the current value of factSum is multiplied by the loop variable i,
       and the result is stored back in factSum. This gradually builds up the factorial of n.
    -> After the loop completes, the method returns the value of factSum, which now contains the factorial of the input n. If n is 0, the loop doesnâ€™t execute, 
       and factSum remains 1 as expected for 0! = 1.
#TIME COMPLEXITY:
   -> Here we iterate form 1 to N so the time complexity is O(N).
