APPROACH:
  -> Even numbers are numbers which divisible by 2.
  -> so to check given number is even or odd then divide it by 2.
  -> if remainder is 0 then it is even else the given number is odd.
  -> Ex: even numbers are 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,.....
#CODE
  class Solution {
    static String oddEven(int n) {
        if(n%2==0){ // %(modulo) operator check reminder, / check quotient. if remainder is 0 it is odd.
            return "even";
        }
        return "odd";
    }
}

#TIME COMPLEXITY: O(1) -> constant time.
