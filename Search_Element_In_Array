APPROACH:
   -> Search for an element in an array. And return its index.
   Ex: [1,2,3,4,5], search element is 3, so you need to return its index that is 2.
#CODE:
  class Solution {
    static int search(int arr[], int x) {
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]==x){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
     }
   }
#EXPLAINATION:
   -> This loop iterates over the array arr using an index variable i.
   -> arr.length provides the number of elements in the array.
   -> Inside the loop, the condition arr[i] == x checks if the current element in the array (arr[i]) is equal to the target element (x).
   -> If a match is found, the method immediately returns the index i of the matching element.
#TIME COMPLEXITY:
   -> In best case if the element is found at first index the time complexity is O(1).
   -> In worst case if the element is found at last index the time complexity is O(N).
