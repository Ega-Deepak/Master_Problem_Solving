APPROACH:
   -> Decimal System (Base 10):
        -> It is based on 10 digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
        -> Example: 325 = 3*(10^2) + 2*(10^1) + 5*(10^0). 
   -> Binary System (Base 2):
        -> The binary number system is used in computers and digital systems.
        -> It is based on 2 digits: 0 and 1.
        -> Example: 1011 = 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 1*(2^1)+ 1*(2^0).

CONVERSION FROM DECIMAL TO BINARY
  -> To convert a decimal number to binary:
  -> Divide the decimal number by 2.
  -> Record the remainder (either 0 or 1).
  -> Divide the quotient by 2 and repeat until the quotient is 0.
  -> The binary representation is the remainders read in reverse order.
#CODE
  class Solution{
	void toBinary(int N) {
		String s="";
		while(N>0){
		    int temp=N%2;
		    s=temp+s;
		    N=N/2;
		}
		System.out.print(s);
	}
 }
#EXPLAINATION:
  -> Compute the remainder of 𝑁when divided by 2(N % 2). This gives the least significant bit (LSB) of the binary representation.
  -> Add this remainder as the most significant bit (MSB) in the string s.
  -> Update 𝑁 by dividing it by 2 (N = N / 2) to move to the next bit.
#TIME COMPLEXITY
  -> The time complexity is the number of digits. the while loop iterates the number of digit times so O(N).
