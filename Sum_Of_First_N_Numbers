APPROACH: 
#BRUTE FORCE: The sum of natural numbers represents that the sum from 0 to N.
   -> here 1-10 Natural numbers represents 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=55.
 #CODE FOR BRUTE FORCE:
    class Solution {
        public static long seriesSum(int n) {
            long sum=0;
            for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
                sum=sum+i;
            }
            return sum;
        }
    }
-> Here for loop is used to iterate from 0 to N and sum variable is add the values from 0 to N.
-> Here time complexity for this code is O(N).
#OPTIMAL APPROACH:
  -> We use optimal approach to reduce the time complexity.
  -> To calculate sum of first N natural numbers we use formula.
  -> That is (N*(N+1))/2.
  -> Ex: sum of first 10 natural numbers
      (10*(10+1))/2 -> (10*(11))/2 -> (110)/2 -> 55.
 #CODE FOR OPTIMAL FORCE:
    class Solution {
        public static long seriesSum(int n) {
            long sum=((long)n*(long)(n+1))/2;// here we convert into long so the int will not go out of range.
            return sum;
        }
    }
-> Here we calculated sum of first N natural numbers using formula.
-> Time complexity for this code is O(1).
