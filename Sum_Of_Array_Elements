APPROACH:
   -> Sum up all elements in an array and return its sum.
   -> Ex: [1,2,3,4,5], sum is 15.
#CODE:
class Solution {
    int arraySum(int arr[]) {
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            sum=sum+arr[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
#EXPLAINATION:
  -> A variable sum is initialized to 0. This will store the cumulative sum of the array elements.
  -> A for loop iterates through each element of the array (arr), with the loop variable i ranging from 0 to arr.length - 1.
  -> Inside the loop, each array element (arr[i]) is added to sum.
  -> After the loop completes, the method returns the final value of sum, which is the sum of all elements in the array.
#TIME COMPLEXITY:
  -> Here the loop iterate for the length of an array so time complexity is O(N).
