# APPROACH: 
  -> Here we need to take each digit from number and then sum it. To get each number we use %(moudlo) operator.
     Ex: 12 -> 1 + 2 = 3
     -> To get 2 first we modulo(%) by 10 which gives 2 then we add it to sum variable and then the original number need to convert to 1 so we divide it by 10.
     -> 12 / 10 = 1, so now number is 1 and then again we use modulo operator repeat previous step and these process will continue until the number is greater then 0.
 # CODE
   class Solution {
    static int sumOfDigits(int n) {
        int sum=0;
        while(n>0){
            int remainder=n%10;
            sum+=remainder;
            n=n/10;
        }
        return sum;
     }
  }

 #TIME COMPLEXITY
  -> Here we iterate while loop until the number becomes 0. so it will take time as number of digits. O(Number of digits).
  -> Consider Number of digits as N so time complexity is O(N).
